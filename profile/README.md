# 🧵 Knitli

**We build the context layer for AI — infrastructure that makes agents efficient, predictable, and human-friendly.** 🧵

Knitli is rethinking how humans and AI work together.
Today’s AI agents are powerful but wasteful — constantly re-reading the same information, burning tokens on repetitive tasks (💲💲🪙), and struggling with context.

We’re building tools that give **AI agents and humans the right context** — so both can work faster, smarter, and with less waste.

## 🗻 Our Vision

A world where AI fits seamlessly into human workflows. No prompt engineering. No repetitive context or information overload. **Just tools that make sense for humans *and* agents.** 🤖👩‍🎨

---

## 🌟 What We’re About

* **Context is king** – everything starts with the right information at the right time.
* **Humans first** – design for people, not prompts. Technology should solve real problems without causing new ones.
* **Build in the open** – our core is and will always be open source.

---

## 🛠️ Current Projects

* **Context Layer SDK** – core libraries and APIs to feed structured, predictive, context to AI agents.

  * [**CodeWeaver**](https://github.com/knitli/codeweaver-mcp) – a tailored context delivery platform, appearing as an MCP server.
  * [**Thread**](https://github.com/knitli/thread) – a platform-agnostic, real-time codebase intelligence engine using graphs + ASTs to keep agents continuously and correctly informed.
* **UI Experiments** – early explorations to make powerful tools intuitive for non-technical users.
