# 🧵 Knitli

**We design tools for agents and humans to be better at their jobs**. 🧵

Knitli is rethinking how humans and AI work together.
AI agents today are powerful but wasteful — constantly re-parsing the same information, burning tokens on repetitive tasks, and struggling with context.

We’re building **the context layer**:

* Gives AI agents exactly what they need, up front.
* Offloads tasks they’re bad at.
* Lets them focus on what they do best.

The result: **faster work, lower cost, less waste** — starting with software development but designed for everyone.

## 🌟 What We’re About

* **No prompt engineering required** – tools that just work.
* **Design first, empathy always** – technology should serve humans and solve real problems without causing new ones.
* **Open collaboration** – we’re building in public as much as possible. Our core is and will always be open source. 

## 🛠️ Current Projects

* **Context Layer SDK** – Starting with:
  *  [CodeWeaver](https://github.com/knitli/codeweaver-mcp) a tailored context delivery platform pretending to be an MCP server.
  *  [Thread](https://github.com/knitli/thread) a platform agnostic, real-time, codebase intelligence :brain: tool using graphs and abstract syntax trees to keep agents continuously and correctly informed.
* **UI Experiments** – making powerful tools feel intuitive for non-technical users... for, later.
